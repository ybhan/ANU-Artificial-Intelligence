My encoding computes the 3 small instances quite fast:
5-3: 50ms
8-4: 60ms
12-4: 60ms

21-4 needs more than 1 minute with G12-fd.
However, it takes only 90ms to solve 21-8 with G12-MIP. The solution are shown below:

21	8		
1	8	0	2
2	7	0	3
3	7	0	3
4	7	0	3
5	5	0	1
5	6	0	3
5	7	0	1
6	4	0	4
6	5	0	1
7	3	0	5
8	2	0	2
8	3	0	3
9	2	0	1
9	5	2	0
9	8	2	0
10	4	1	0
10	5	4	0
11	3	1	0
11	4	4	0
12	1	0	3
