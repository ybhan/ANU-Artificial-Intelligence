As I reported in Q2, I now have to apply the slow method in order to derive the real routines. Unfortunately, it can solve the smallest 5-3 instance in 1 minute. The 8-4 problem can be solved in 10 minutes but far excesses the 1-minute limit.

5-3: 6s
8-4: in 10 minutes, or in 1 minutes with G12-MIP
12-4 & 21-8: time out

The 8-4 solution that I obtain:

8	4	12085.95
1	1	4	0	20
2	1	2	4	0
2	2	1	3	0
2	3	3	5	6
3	1	4	11	3
