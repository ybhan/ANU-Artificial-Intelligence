I write two encodings to solve this problem based on Q1. The fundamental idea is to solve the original problem as Q1, and meanwhile assign a sequence for each truck.

During my experiment, I come up with two data structures to record the sequences. One is step[trucks, customers], whose column indices are customers and the variable means when the truck visits the customer. The other is pos[trucks, times], which stores customers in the exact visiting order.

In practice, the former consumes almost only 1/10 of the time the latter needs. Statistically:

5-3: 100ms
8-4: 50ms
12-4: 1.5s
21-8: 47s

Even the 21-8 problem can be solved in 1 min, how surprising!!!

However, this amazing method cannot tell me the real visiting sequence, so in Q3 I have to go back to the latter data structure.
