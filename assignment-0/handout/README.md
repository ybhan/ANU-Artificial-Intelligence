# Assignment 0: Python — Tutorial

This assignment is designed to introduce the core concepts of Python 3 and ensure that you have the skills required to complete the subsequent assignments.

Python is an object-oriented, interpreted, garbage collected, dynamically typed language where white space matters.

It has a vast API and is widely used for scientific programming (via [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/)).

It can function as a Matlab replacement (via [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [MatPlotLib](http://matplotlib.org/)).

## Useful Resources

Help on the concepts we are covering can be obtained from the excellent, free, online textbook [How To Think Like a Computer Scientist — Learning with Python](http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/).

The official [Python tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) may also be helpful.

[Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/) can visualise the execution of Python code snippets, allowing you to step forward and backward through the program's execution. If you're confused by a piece of demonstration code in this tutorial, consider executing it in Python Tutor to get a better understanding of what it is doing.

Python has a standard [style guide](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) called PEP 8, which many people adhere to. You may wish to peruse this to get a sense of what constitutes good style. The standard style will not be rigorously enforced, but particularly egregious violations may attract penalties if they make your code hard to understand.

## Installing Python

This course uses Python 3\. Due to incompatibilities between different major versions of the language, it is imperative that you develop your assignments using Python 3 rather than Python 2\. On Linux and OS X, you can check whether you have Python 3 installed by opening up a terminal and entering `python3 --version`. The command should print something like “Python 3.5.2+” to the screen. It's okay if the minor version is slightly different—the important thing is that the major version should be Python 3 (3.4.X, 3.5.X, 3.6.X, etc. are all fine).

If you don't have Python already on your computer, we recommend you install
[Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

If you're using a CSIT lab computer, you need to use the `Anaconda3 shell`
to run Python (don't use the built-in terminal). Ask your tutor if you don't
know what this means.

Note for Windows users: Make sure that you install Python in a path that
doesn't contain any spaces (e.g. don't put it in `Program Files`).
